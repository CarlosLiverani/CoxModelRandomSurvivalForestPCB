# CoxModelRandomSurvivalForestPCB
In this project we'll develop risk models using survival data and a combination of linear(Cox model) and non-linear(Random Survival Forests) techniques. We'll be using a dataset with survival data of patients with Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (pbc). PBC is a progressive disease of the liver caused by a buildup of bile within the liver (cholestasis) that results in damage to the small bile ducts that drain bile from the liver. Our goal will be to understand the effects of different factors on the survival times of the patients.
